# Adding a gaudi module

Part of gaudi is a set of conventions for managing the build system code.

A gaudi module is a directory structure within the gaudi library code that hosts the rake tasks and helper code.

Go ahead and add the directory structure

```sh
mkdir -p /workspace/gaudi-workshop/tools/build/lib/workshop/helpers
mkdir -p /workspace/gaudi-workshop/tools/build/lib/workshop/tasks
```

Add the module name in `tools/build/system.cfg`

```properties
gaudi_modules=workshop
```

From this point on, all Ruby code placed in the `helpers` directory will be automatically required and available to code in the tasks directory.
