# Something To Build

First of all, we need something to build. For this we are going to use the source files that define the container image we are already using.

Copy the files from the gaudi-example clone

```sh
mkdir -p src
cp -r /workspace/gaudi-example/src /workspace/gaudi-workshop
```

## Adding a build task

Go ahead and create `tools/build/lib/workshop/tasks/build.rb` with

```ruby
namespace :build do
  desc "Build the workshop image"
  task :devenv do
    sh("docker build -t gaudi-workshop:latest #{$configuration.base}/src/workshop")
  end
end
```

This is the simplest way possible way of integrating different tools within rake tasks: a shell call.

It also illustrates the bulk of the work when creating a build system: put together strings that represent paths and command lines and execute them.
