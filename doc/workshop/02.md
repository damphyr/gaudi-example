# Something To Build

First of all, we need something to build. For this we are going to use the source files that define the container image we are already using.

Copy the files from the gaudi-example clone

```sh
mkdir -p src
cp -r /workspace/gaudi-example/src /workspace/gaudi-workshop
```

## Adding a build task

Go ahead and create tools/build/lib/workshop/tasks/build.rb with

```ruby
namespace :build do
  desc "Build the workshop image"
  task :devenv do
    sh("docker build -t gaudi-workshop:latest #{$configuration.base}/src/devenv")
  end
end
```
