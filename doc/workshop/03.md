# The Gaudi system Configuration

The single source of truth for gaudi is the system configuration.

This by default and by convention is a text file named `system.cfg` which is parsed and becomes a context object available via the variable `$configuration` within the build system.

The [configuration format](https://github.com/damphyr/gaudi/blob/main/doc/CONFIGURATION.md) is simple but is backed with a little bit of "magic", especially when it comes to handling paths.

For the purposes of this workshop we will stick with the default settings.

```ruby
$configuration.base # the root of the workspace and the default used for calculating relative paths
$configuration.out # The output directory used in out-of-source builds. Is removed by clean:wipe
```

Looking at the build task we implemented:

```ruby
namespace :build do
  desc "Build the workshop image"
  task :devenv do
    sh("docker build -t gaudi-workshop:latest #{$configuration.base}/src/devenv")
  end
end
```
