# Breadcrumbs

Like Hansel and Gretel, we want to be able to trace the path we took to the latest command failure.

Reading/parsing stdout output for every command is inefficient both for the machine as well as the person.

We need a way of executing shell commands safely, detecting failures and logging their output.

Copy the following

```sh
cp /workspace/gaudi-example/tools/build/lib/workshop/helpers/execution.rb /workspace/gaudi-workshop/tools/build/lib/workshop/helpers/execution.rb
```

Change our build task implementation to

```ruby
namespace :build do
  desc "Build the workshop image"
  task :devenv do
    include Execution
    cmdline= "docker build -t gaudi-workshop:latest #{$configuration.base}/src/workshop"
    run_command("Build workshop image",cmdline,$configuration)
  end
end
```

and run it.

Once it is completed we will take a look in `/workspace/gaudi-workshop/out/logs`.

We have introduced a way of retaining a log of every command executed by introducing a "library" of sorts, called [Execution](../../tools/build/lib/workshop/helpers/execution.rb).
