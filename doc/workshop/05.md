# Gaudi helpers

Any Ruby code placed in the `helpers/` subdirectory will be loaded when gaudi starts.

By convention we organize re-usable functionality in Ruby methods grouped in Ruby modules and place one module per file.

The gaudi [coding style](https://github.com/damphyr/gaudi/blob/main/doc/STYLE.md) states a few rules that help make the helper code more uniform. These are on top of the general Ruby community coding style which can be enforced with [rubocop](https://rubocop.org/) and [rufo](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo).

## Documentation

Gaudi enables the generation of reference documentation using Ruby's [RDoc](https://ruby.github.io/rdoc/)

The documentation generation will also pick up all Markdown documents found in the `doc/` directory.

```sh
rake doc:gaudi
```
