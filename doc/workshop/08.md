# Gaudi modules

The gaudi gem offers an interface for maintaining gaudi installations and also a simple way of sharing gaudi modules.

To import the gaudi-c module from the gaudi repository run:

```sh
gaudi -l gaudi-c https://github.com/damphyr/gaudi.git .
```

Add the module name to the configuration to enable it.

The only requirement is that the repository containing the gaudi module should place the module code in the *lib/module_name* directory

The choice of importing the code directly into the repository instead of using gems (Ruby libraries) is a conscious one: The build system is versioned with the repository revision, there is no intermediate release step for build system functionality and patches and bugfixes can be applied directly.
