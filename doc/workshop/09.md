# Going further

The [repository hosting the material for this workshop](https://github.com/damphyr/gaudi-example) also hosts the gaudi code that builds the workshop development environment and demostrates how relatively advanced tricks (i.e. Docker tags dependent on the content of the images) can be added without changing the usage patterns.

The largest (public) gaudi setup is in the source for the [NHS Covid 19 backend](https://github.com/nihp-public/covid19-app-system-public), a cloud-native, serverless system running on AWS.

It is a good example of how a gaudi-based build system evolves in a fast pace environment over time: not clean, not always consistent but arguably easier to navigate and reason about.
