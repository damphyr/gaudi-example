# The gaudi approach

Gaudi offers four core "features"

* Code organisation conventions
  * Because a build system is a software system and requires the same quality standards
* A configuration system
  * Because there should be "One Source of Truth" and one place to look for it
* A documentation concept with tool support
  * Because a build system codifies expertise and knowledge to be communicated
* A command line calling convention and way of interfacing with the OS environment
  * Because some things are not meant to be version controlled
